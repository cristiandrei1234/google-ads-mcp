# greenfield-market-research

## Cadence
Before first campaign build.

## Objective
Estimate viable demand and intent landscape for a new Google Ads program.

## Workflow
- Define seed topics from services, products, and customer pain points.
- Generate keyword ideas and cluster by intent: transactional, commercial, informational, brand.
- Pull historical metrics to estimate monthly demand, competition intensity, and top-of-page bid ranges.
- Build geo and language slices to identify priority launch markets.
- Summarize market entry recommendation with focus terms, exclusions, and risk notes.

## Core MCP Tools
- generate_keyword_ideas
- generate_keyword_historical_metrics
- run_gaql_query
- list_reach_plan_locations
- generate_reach_forecast

## Expected Outputs
- Intent cluster map with priority tiers
- Demand and competition snapshot by location
- Recommended launch scope and exclusions

## Guardrails
- Do not mix exploratory informational terms into initial performance campaign sets.
- Keep brand and non-brand intent separated from day one.
- Document every assumption when no account history exists.
