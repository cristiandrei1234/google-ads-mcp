# ad-copy-refresh-assistant

## Cadence
2-3 times per week

## Objective
Sustain ad strength and improve engagement without breaking message-market fit.

## Workflow
- Identify ads/ad groups with weak CTR/CVR trends and stale copy patterns.
- Draft replacement headline/description variants aligned with winning query intent.
- Apply updates with controlled rollout and preserve old resource references in report.
- Monitor early performance after refresh window.

## Core MCP Tools
- list_ads
- get_search_terms
- update_ad_content
- create_responsive_search_ad

## Expected Outputs
- Refresh candidates with rationale
- New copy set per ad group
- Change log for post-analysis

## Guardrails
- Respect compliance-sensitive vertical wording constraints.
- Do not remove all historical copy variants at once.
- Keep final URLs and tracking intact.
